exploration (page 498), construction and testing (page 499), hypothesis-testing, demonstration, and modeling (page 500)
Denning listed modeling, simulation, measurement, validation, prototyping, testing, performance analysis, and comparisons

(1) Form a hypothesis, 
(2) construct a model and make a prediction, 
(3) design an experiment and collect data, and 
(4) analyze results. 



historical methods, which collect data from already completed projects; 
and controlled methods, which attempt to increase the statistical validity of results by providing multiple instances of observations.


Typically, in reports of those studies, it is not known if (or rather, “not shown that”) system  outperforms system  with data set  and parameters 


There again, many fields of computing have introduced standard tests, input data, and expected outputs, against which competing solutions can be compared
