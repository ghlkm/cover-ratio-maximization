\chapter{PROBLEM DEFINITION}
\label{chap:chap-two}

In this section, we will firstly introduce related concept and then propose our 
problem.  

{\bfseries Definition 1.} A product $p$'s score respecting to a user $w$ is the 
dot product $p\cdot w$.

Without loss of generality, $w$ satisfies $w[i]\in [0, 1]$, $p$ satisfies 
$p[i]\in [0, 1]$ and $\Sigma_{i=1}^d w[i]=1$. We also take the values as larger
as better for products and so the larger the score the better.

{\bfseries Definition 2.} A product $p$ covers a user $w$ when the score 
respecting to $w$ ranks top-$k$ among $D$.

{\bfseries Problem 1.} The $k-Cover Ratio Maximization$ takes product dataset 
$D$, $P\subset D$, user data set $W$ and a positive integer $k$ as inputs. 
It introduces how to determine a new product $p$ such that satisfies the 
constraint $C(p)\leq B$ and maximizes the cover ratio of $P\cap \{p\}$:  
\begin{displaymath}
  cp(p, P, k)=\frac{|\left\{w|\forall w\in W, \left\{P\cup\left\{p \right\}\right\}\cap TopK(w)\neq \emptyset  \right\}|}{|W|}  
\end{displaymath}

For the sake of convenient, we define constraint $C(p)\leq B$ as $\Sigma_{i=1}^d p[i] \leq B$.
