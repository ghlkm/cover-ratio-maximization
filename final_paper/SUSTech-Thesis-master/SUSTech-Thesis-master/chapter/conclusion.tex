\label{chap:conclusion}
Motivated by the need of introducing new product, we proposal our problem kCRM, 
which is aim to find the exact optimal solution that covers the most rest users which
product dataset $P$ can't cover. We use data structure $CellTree$ introduced in 
$kSPR$ as our baseline. Then we base on the relationship between constraint and user 
insertion
halfspace to prune unrelated users and get lower bound of optimal solution to prune
the nodes in $CellTree$. Besides, we change the insertion order of user halfspaces 
to more efficiently process insertion reducing the possible useless nodes.
In our paper, we use experiments to show our optimization for the baseline did improve it
a great deal and we find some inner connection between efficiency of our approach 
and constraint. For the future work, we can perform further study the effect of insertion
order of halfspaces to more efficiently solve $kCRM$ and so that we can deal with larger
user datasets.
